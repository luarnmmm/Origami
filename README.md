### About Us
Origami Learning was started as a group project to bring younger generations fun origami pieces they could create at school or in their home.

Our mission at DesignNet Inc. is to utilize technology by providing teachers the tools necessary to continue teaching the youth about origami, from its origins to projects they can do.
